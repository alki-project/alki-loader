# Alki::Loader

Alki loader is a library for using "non-standard" source files in your project. What is
a non-standard source file?

Generally a ruby source file follows these rules:

1. It should be placed in a directory that is in `$LOAD_PATH`, so that it can be loaded using `require`.
2. It should define one ore more constants.
3. Ideally, it should just define a constant that is the "classified" version of the relative path of the
   file (if a directory `/project/lib` is in `$LOAD_DIR` and there is a file called `/project/lib/my_mod/my_class.rb`
   then the constant defined within it should be `MyMod::MyClass`).

This works well much of the time, but often enough it's nice to break some of these rules.
For example, you might want files in directories in your project like `config` or `app` but don't want
to add those to `$LOAD_PATH` because it could cause conflicts, or maybe you have files that you don't
want to just define a module or class (like a DSL).

Alki::Loader provides tools that enable these patterns while still allowing you to use these files
in standard ways.

There are three main components of Alki::Loader:

Translater:: Allows registering directory and file paths with fake "names" so, for example, your
         projects `config` directory could be registered with the name `my_project/config`. Now
         when calling `require 'my_project/config/my_config'` Ruby will load `config/my_config.rb`
         (but `require 'my_config'` will still find nothing).

Builder:: Allows registering directory and file paths with "builder" objects and configuration values.
          Files under these paths put their code in an unevaluated block that is passed to the builder
          so that it can process it and ultimately define the expected constant for that path with
          a value.

Registry:: To allow the other two components to work, paths must be registered with Alki::Loader. This
           can be done anytime in code but can also be set by putting register calls in an `alk_loader.rb`
           file in any directory in `$LOAD_PATH`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alki-loader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alki-loader

## Usage

```ruby
require 'alki/loader'
```

Once the library is required you can require files as you normally would.

To register a path, use `Alki::Loader.register(path,settings)`. This can be called anywhere at any
time, but to make sure your paths are registered before they're needed, it's best to use an
`alki_loader.rb` file.

To use one create a `alki_loader.rb` file in whatever directory in your project is in `$LOAD_PATH`
(typically `lib`). It should just contain normal `Alki::Loader.register` calls.

The path argument to register should either be an absolute path, or a path relative to directory of the
calling file (if you have `Alki::Loader.register '../config', ... ` in `lib/alki_loader.rb` it will
register `config`).

If path registrations exist for multiple prefixes of the same file, the longest one will be used.

### Settings

When registering a path, the second argument is hash of settings to configure the path. These can be
arbitrary key/value pairs but there are two setting values with special meaning.

[horizontal]
name:: Provide a name for the translater to use for this path. Will translate just the registered
       path and leave the rest of the path the same when changed.
builder:: Set the builder object, if one is wanted. Can be any object with a `build` method or a require
          path where a constant can be found that has a build class method (`my_project/my_builder` will
          attempt to find `MyProject::MyBuilder` and will call `require 'my_project/my_builder'`
          to try and find it).

### Builders

A file that is to be built using a builder should always be in an Alki block:

.my_file.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  # stuff goes here
end
```

When the file is loaded, the builder object registered for the path will be called like so:

```ruby
builder.build settings, &blk
```

Where `blk` is the unevaluated block from the file, and `settings` is a hash containing all of the
settings registered to the path, along with two extra settings so the builder knows what file it's
building.

[horizontal]
name:: What would be passed to `require` to load the file. If the file is in a `$LOAD_PATH` directory
       it will be the relative path from the directory minus the '.rb'. If there is name translation
       registered on the path, that will be used instead.
constant_name:: The "class-ified" version of the name, following the typical rules for translating
                require paths into constant names. No special rules are used for abbreviations.
